# cg_rogue Todo

## Bugs
* Path select needs to be able to select source's tile
* Target select should not be able to select own tile
* Pushing off the edge results in crash
* Flying enemy when next to target, moves 1
* Can select a card, then do any number of basic actions

## Organizational
* Figure out how to get the Rest action out of the player package
