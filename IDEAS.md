## Action Values
There are several action values that are needed to adjust dynamically. Obvious examples include `damage`, `movement`, and `targets`.

However, what if each action had a stat it was tied to? For instance, `damage` could be tied to Strength, while `range` could be tied to Dexterity.

#### Current Values:
* Damage
* Movement
* Range
* Targets

#### Possible Values:
* Damage (per damage type)
* Damage (melee v ranged)
* Flight
* Leap

Is there a way to do this more dynamically, per card?
